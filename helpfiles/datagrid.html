		This displays a table that can be sorted and filtered.<br>
		Columns are sorted by clicking ones (ascending) or twice (descending).
		Filter is available via upper-left cog-wheel menu. Select "Show filter-row" to add a filter row.
		Default it filters anything containing the search string. A star "*" is used to define "anything".<br><br>
		<u>Search Examples/Syntax:</u><br>
		"123*" anything starting with 123,<br>
		"*123" anything ending with 123,<br>
		"*1*2*3*" any combination having 1,2,3 in a sequence like "38<b>1</b>6<b>2</b>57<b>3</b>0",<br>
		"=123" equal to 123,<br>"<>123" not equal to 123<br>
		">123" greater than 123,<br>">=123" greater than or equal to 123,<br>
		"<123" less than 123,<br>"<=123" less than or equal to 123,<br><br>
	<u>Search Of Sets:</u><br>
		By adding a comma, each search item is included.<br>
		So an item search that looks like "6123886180,6123897681,6123897682"<br /> 
		results in "*6123886180* OR *6123897681* OR *6123897682*"<br>
		while "=6123886180,6123897681,6123897682"<br> 
		results in "'6123886180' OR '6123897681' OR '6123897682'"
		<br><br>
	<u>Hierarchy Search:</u><br>
	Following hierarchies are used in Pricing: ALSIS Product, Geography and Industry. <br>
	To search parents or children, folowing syntax is used:<br>
	Product is Parent: "pup"<br>
	Product is Child: "pdn"<br>
	Industry is Parent: "iup"<br>
	Industry is Child: "idn"<br>
	Geography is Parent: "gup"<br>
	Geography is Child: "gdn"<br><br>
	Example in Items list searching product_code "pupB2999" will return items having "B2999" as parent.<br><br>
		A pre-filtered table is indicated by a yellow filter symbol on the cogg-wheel.<br>
		This pre-filter can be handled using the cog-menu "Clear preFilter". If the pre-filter is default, it can be added again by "Add preFilter".<br><br>
